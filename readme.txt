Once installed, titles and body copy can be easily tweaked by authors right on the live page instead of the WordPress admin.

== Description ==

ClickToEdit will make your site 'live' to authors so they can edit titles and body copy. Additional functions mean you can make any piece of content: title, body or custom field, instantly editable. Great for tweaking copy or fixing errors on the fly.

== Installation ==

1. Download the latest version.
2. Extract it in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. In Settings->ClickToEdit decide if you want to take advantage of automatic editing or if you prefer to put the calls in manually.
